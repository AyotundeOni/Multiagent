Drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is having a **profound and rapidly accelerating impact**. Here are some of the newest and most significant developments:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **\"De Novo\" Drug Design:** This is a major breakthrough. Instead of screening existing libraries of compounds, generative AI models (like those used in creating art or text) can now design entirely *new* molecules from scratch that are predicted to have specific properties and bind to target proteins. This opens up vast chemical spaces previously inaccessible.\n    *   **Examples:** Companies like **Insilico Medicine**, **Atomwise**, and **BenevolentAI** are heavily invested in this. Insilico Medicine recently announced that their AI-designed drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is entering Phase 2 clinical trials – a significant milestone.\n*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** Once a promising molecule is identified, AI can then fine-tune its structure to improve its potency, reduce toxicity, and enhance its pharmacokinetic properties (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes it).\n\n**2. AI for Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Unraveling Disease Mechanisms:** AI can sift through massive datasets – genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, patient health records, and scientific literature – to identify novel biological targets that are implicated in diseases.\n    *   **Beyond \"Druggable\" Targets:** AI is helping researchers identify targets that might have been overlooked by traditional methods, including those considered \"undruggable\" in the past.\n*   **Predicting Target Efficacy:** Before investing heavily in a drug candidate, AI can predict how likely a specific target is to respond to therapeutic intervention.\n\n**3. Revolutionizing Pre-Clinical and Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models can predict how well a drug candidate will work and what its potential side effects might be *before* expensive and time-consuming animal or human trials. This helps to weed out less promising candidates early on.\n*   **Accelerating Clinical Trial Design:** AI can analyze patient data to:\n    *   **Identify optimal patient populations:** Stratifying patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular drug.\n    *   **Optimize trial endpoints and protocols.**\n    *   **Predict recruitment challenges.**\n*   **\"In Silico\" Trials:** While not replacing human trials entirely, AI is enabling more sophisticated computer simulations to test drug candidates under various conditions.\n\n**4. Protein Folding and Structure Prediction:**\n\n*   **AlphaFold's Impact:** DeepMind's AlphaFold has been a game-changer in accurately predicting the 3D structure of proteins. This is critical because a drug's effectiveness often depends on how it interacts with a protein's specific shape.\n    *   **Accelerated Understanding:** Knowing protein structures allows researchers to design drugs that fit perfectly into their target sites, much like a key fits a lock.\n*   **Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions:** AI can also predict how proteins interact with each other, offering new insights into disease pathways and potential drug intervention points.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze vast databases of existing drugs and disease information to identify potential new therapeutic uses for drugs already approved for other conditions. This is much faster and cheaper than developing a new drug from scratch.\n\n**Key Trends and Companies to Watch:**\n\n*   **The Rise of \"AI-Native\" Biotech Companies:** Many new biotech companies are founded with AI at their core, rather than as an add-on.\n*   **Partnerships:** Big Pharma is increasingly partnering with AI drug discovery companies to leverage their specialized technologies.\n*   **Focus on Complex Diseases:** AI is particularly promising for tackling challenging diseases like Alzheimer's, rare genetic disorders, and certain cancers where traditional methods have struggled.\n\n**In summary, AI is not just incrementally improving drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing the paradigm.** It's making the process faster, more efficient, more predictive, and opening up possibilities for designing novel therapies that were once unimaginable.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **\"AI for Target Identification and Validation\"** development. This is a critical and exciting area because finding the right *target* is the foundational step in developing any new drug.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what this entails and why it's so transformative:\n\n**What is a Drug Target?**\n\nA drug target is essentially a molecule in the body that a drug is designed to interact with to produce a therapeutic effect. Most often, these targets are proteins, but they can also be genes, RNA molecules, or even specific pathways within cells.\n\n**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\nHistorically, finding new drug targets has been a slow, arduous, and often serendipitous process. It involved:\n\n*   **Deep understanding of disease biology:** Researchers would spend years studying a disease to identify potential molecular players.\n*   **Extensive laboratory experiments:** This involved a lot of trial and error, hypothesis testing, and painstaking work.\n*   **Limited data integration:** It was difficult to synthesize information from disparate sources (e.g., genetics, cell biology, clinical observations).\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), is a powerful tool for overcoming these limitations by:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Massive and Diverse Datasets:**\n    *   **Genomic Data:** AI can scan vast amounts of genetic information from large patient cohorts to identify genes or genetic variations that are strongly associated with a particular disease.\n    *   **Proteomic and Metabolomic Data:** AI can analyze the abundance of proteins and metabolites in cells or tissues to pinpoint molecules that are dysregulated in disease states.\n    *   **Patient Health Records (EHRs):** With proper anonymization and ethical considerations, AI can analyze EHRs to identify patterns and correlations that might point to previously unrecognized disease drivers.\n    *   **Scientific Literature:** NLP algorithms can \"read\" millions of research papers, extracting key information about genes, proteins, pathways, and disease associations that might be missed by human researchers.\n    *   **Imaging Data:** AI can analyze medical images to identify biomarkers associated with disease progression or specific molecular pathways.\n\n2.  **Identifying Novel Disease Mechanisms and Pathways:**\n    *   **Network Analysis:** AI can build complex biological networks, showing how genes, proteins, and other molecules interact. By analyzing these networks, AI can identify \"bottlenecks\" or key nodes that, if targeted, could disrupt disease progression.\n    *   **Predicting Causal Relationships:** Beyond just finding correlations, AI can help infer causal relationships between molecular changes and disease development.\n\n3.  **Validating Potential Targets:**\n    *   **Predicting Target \"Druggability\":** AI can help assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be amenable to drug intervention (e.g., does it have a binding site that a small molecule or antibody could interact with?).\n    *   **Prioritizing Targets:** With so many potential targets, AI can rank them based on factors like strength of association with disease, predicted therapeutic impact, and potential for side effects, helping researchers focus on the most promising ones.\n    *   **Predicting Off-Target Effects:** AI can also help predict if targeting a specific molecule might have unintended consequences on other biological processes.\n\n**Examples and Implications:**\n\n*   **Unlocking \"Undruggable\" Targets:** Traditionally, some proteins were considered too difficult to drug due to their structure or lack of a clear binding site. AI is helping to identify new ways to interact with these targets or to find entirely new targets within complex pathways.\n*   **Accelerated Discovery:** What might have taken years of manual research can now potentially be achieved in months or even weeks with AI.\n*   **Broader Therapeutic Areas:** AI's ability to analyze complex data is particularly valuable for diseases with intricate underlying biology, such as neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases, and complex cancers.\n\n**Companies and Research Groups:**\n\nMany companies are actively developing AI platforms for target identification, including:\n\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Known for its AI-powered knowledge graph and target identification capabilities.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses machine learning and automation to map cellular biology and identify disease targets.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** A leader in generative AI for drug discovery, which starts with target identification.\n*   **Schrödinger:** While known for physics-based simulations, they are increasingly integrating AI for target identification and drug design.\n\nIn essence, AI is acting as a highly intelligent, tireless researcher, sifting through an ever-growing mountain of biological data to uncover the most critical levers for treating diseases. This fundamentally changes how we think about the starting point of drug development.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies at the forefront of **AI-driven target identification and validation** in drug discovery.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
