    "**Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Agents course!**\n",

    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "In this notebook, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

    "> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",

    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n",

      "    *   **Easier Evolution:** Individual agents can be updated or replaced independently without a massive overhaul of the entire application.\n",

      "    *   **Scale with Ease:** Need more processing power or handling capacity? Simply add more agents to the system. This distributed approach offers inherent scalability.\n",
      "    *   **Fault Tolerance as Standard:** If one agent fails, others can often pick up its workload or compensate, creating a more resilient and fault-tolerant application.\n",

      "InitialWriterAgent > Elias traced the salt-worn lines of the ancient chart. It had washed ashore during the last storm, tucked into a splintered crate. Tonight, under the steady beam of the lighthouse, a faint luminescence bloomed from its surface. Not ink, but starlight captured on parchment. Strange, swirling constellations, unlike any Elias knew, pulsed with an inner light. A single, bold X marked a spot in the vast, inky blackness of the sea. He felt a tremor, not of fear, but of a deep, forgotten longing. The map thrummed, a silent siren song, beckoning him from his lonely tower.\n",
      "CriticAgent > Here are a few suggestions for improving the story:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Develop Elias's character further:** While we get a sense of his loneliness and his yearning, giving him a brief backstory or a specific internal conflict would make him more relatable. For example, why is he a lighthouse keeper? Is he running from something, or is this his chosen solitary life? A hint of this could add depth.\n",
      "2.  **Flesh out the map's discovery and immediate aftermath:** The discovery of the crate and the map is intriguing, but a little more detail could enhance the mystery. Was the crate unusual? Did Elias hesitate to open it? After seeing the map's glow, what are his immediate actions or thoughts beyond the longing? Does he try to decipher it, or is he simply mesmerized?\n",
      "3.  **Build anticipation for the \"X\":** The \"X\" marks a spot, but the story ends there. To create a stronger narrative arc, hint at what the \"X\" might represent or the potential consequences of following it. This could be a more concrete feeling of destiny, a specific legend Elias vaguely remembers, or a subtle shift in the lighthouse's environment.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias, a man who'd sought refuge in the stoic solitude of the lighthouse after a life at sea that had left him with more scars than memories, traced the salt-worn lines of the ancient chart. It had washed ashore during the last storm, tucked into a splintered crate unlike any he'd seen before, its wood darker, its fittings eerily untouched by the sea's corrosive embrace. He'd almost left it on the tide line, a morbid curiosity warring with a deep-seated caution. Tonight, under the steady beam of the lighthouse, a faint luminescence bloomed from its surface. Not ink, but starlight captured on parchment. Strange, swirling constellations, unlike any Elias knew, pulsed with an inner light. A single, bold X marked a spot in the vast, inky blackness of the sea. He felt a tremor, not of fear, but of a deep, forgotten longing, a whisper of the adventurer he once was. The map thrummed, a silent siren song, beckoning him from his lonely tower. His fingers, now no longer hesitant, brushed over the glowing 'X'. A surge of adrenaline, sharp and potent, coursed through him. This wasn't just a map; it felt like a destiny, a chance to trade his quiet penance for an unknown glory, or perhaps, a final, watery grave. He remembered hushed sailor tales of phantom islands and treasures guarded by ancient magic, legends he'd dismissed as fancy. Now, holding this impossible chart, he wondered. The lighthouse beam swept across the waves, and for a fleeting moment, the sea below seemed to swirl with the same unearthly light as the map, as if acknowledging his awakening.\n",
